Emoji-geddon: An Outage Tale of Missing Emojis in HTML Mail

Issue Summary:
Duration: August 8th, 2023, 15:00 - August 9th, 2023, 09:30 (UTC)
Impact: HTML mail service turning into a "no-emoji" zone with slow loading.
Users Affected: About 30% of users experienced a serious case of emoji withdrawal.

Timeline:
- August 8th, 15:30 - Our monitoring alerts went berserk like a caffeinated squirrel in a maze.
- August 8th, 15:45 - Engineers sprang into action, realizing emojis were mysteriously MIA.
- August 8th, 16:30 - First guess: gremlins in the network tubes causing slow-downs.
- August 8th, 17:15 - Network team hunted for gremlins, but only found a suspicious-looking hamster.
- August 8th, 18:30 - Network seemed clean, so we called in the backend Ghostbusters.
- August 8th, 19:00 - The database performance was scrutinized, but it was all just ones and zeros.
- August 9th, 01:00 - Desperation set in as we realized the emojis were playing hide and seek.
- August 9th, 03:00 - Front-end folks discovered emojis were off on an unplanned vacation.
- August 9th, 08:00 - The great revelation: emojis were stranded due to a failed CDN connection.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Turns out, our beloved emojis embarked on an unexpected journey due to a CDN connectivity meltdown. Their vacation left HTML mails feeling incomplete and users longing for those pixelated expressions. We rescued them by recruiting a backup CDN and revamped our emoji-loading circus act, ensuring those tiny characters feel wanted again.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Emoji Brigade: Strengthen monitoring with a "Find the Emojis" mini-game for faster detection.
- Emoji Travel Insurance: Embrace a multi-CDN strategy to prevent future emoji vanishing acts.
- Backup Smiles: Develop an emoji emergency kit stored locally for dire emoji shortages.
- Stress Tests: Initiate regular stress tests to ensure emojis handle peak emotional traffic.
- Emoji Support Hotline: Establish an incident response plan to speed-dial emoji experts.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. üåê Multi-CDN Integration: Woo multiple CDNs into our system for emoji traffic control.
2. üõ°Ô∏è Emoji Bunker: Build a secure local emoji vault to handle emoji droughts.
3. üîç Emoji Detectives: Train monitoring to sniff out rogue emoji disappearances.
4. üß™ Emoji Gym: Set up rigorous emoji workouts to prepare them for peak demand.
5. üöë Emergency Emoji Response: Draft a quick-response playbook for the next emoji emergency.

And so, the tale of Emoji-geddon comes to a close. Our HTML mail service, once plagued by a lack of emojis and slow-loading screens, is now on the path to recovery. With a multi-CDN defense, a local emoji haven, and an arsenal of stress-tested smiles, we are ready to tackle any future emoji escapades. Remember, behind those pixels are feelings, and we're here to make sure those feelings are always delivered on time. üòâ

Issue Summary:
Duration: August 8th, 2023, 15:00 - August 9th, 2023, 09:30 (UTC)
Impact: Degraded HTML mail service with slow loading and missing emojis.
Users Affected: Approximately 30% of users experienced delays and missing emojis in their HTML emails.

Timeline:
- August 8th, 15:30 - Issue detected through monitoring alert indicating increased response times.
- August 8th, 15:45 - Engineering team initiated investigation into the slow response.
- August 8th, 16:30 - Initial assumption made that network latency was causing the issue.
- August 8th, 17:15 - Network team started investigating potential latency spikes.
- August 8th, 18:30 - No evidence of significant network issues found; escalated to backend team.
- August 8th, 19:00 - Backend team investigated database performance as a potential cause.
- August 9th, 01:00 - No substantial issues identified on the database side; escalated to front-end team.
- August 9th, 03:00 - Front-end team focused on frontend rendering performance.
- August 9th, 08:00 - Emojis identified as the root cause, rendering delays and errors due to an external emoji CDN.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue stemmed from an external emoji content delivery network (CDN) experiencing intermittent connectivity problems. Emojis, crucial for HTML mail rendering, were fetched from this CDN. The connectivity disruptions led to slow response times and missing emojis in HTML mails. The problem was resolved by integrating a secondary emoji CDN and optimizing the emoji loading process.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improve Monitoring: Enhance monitoring alerts to detect CDN connectivity issues promptly.
- Diversify CDNs: Integrate multiple emoji CDNs to prevent single-point failures.
- Local Emojis: Implement fallback mechanism to locally store essential emojis.
- Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing to identify potential bottlenecks in the mail rendering process.
- Incident Escalation: Define clear escalation paths to ensure quick handoffs between teams.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Integrate Secondary CDN: Add support for an additional emoji CDN to ensure redundancy.
2. Local Emoji Storage: Develop a mechanism to store critical emojis locally within the application.
3. Enhanced Monitoring: Implement advanced monitoring with thresholds for CDN connectivity.
4. Load Testing Automation: Automate periodic load testing to simulate real-world scenarios.
5. Incident Response Plan: Establish a clear incident response plan to streamline investigations.

This postmortem has outlined the key details of the recent emoji outage that affected the HTML mail service. The incident was traced back to connectivity issues with an external emoji CDN, causing degraded performance and missing emojis in users' emails. By implementing multiple CDNs, storing essential emojis locally, and enhancing monitoring and load testing procedures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a smoother user experience.

In conclusion, this incident underscores the importance of thorough investigation and collaboration across teams to identify and rectify the root cause of issues. Through these corrective measures, we are committed to delivering a more reliable and responsive HTML mail service for our users.
