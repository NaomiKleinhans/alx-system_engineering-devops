Issue Summary:
Duration: August 8th, 2023, 15:00 - August 9th, 2023, 09:30 (UTC)
Impact: HTML mail service turned into a "no-emoji" zone, leading to slower load times and frustrated users trying to decipher emotionless emails. Approximately 30% of users were affected and faced a serious case of emoji withdrawal.
Root Cause: The root cause was traced back to an adventurous emoji CDN that decided to take an unannounced vacation, leaving our emails feeling cold and impersonal.
Timeline:
August 8th, 15:30: 🚨 Alert! Monitoring went wild like a cat on catnip.
August 8th, 15:45: Engineers jumped in like superheroes to save the day—only to find emojis mysteriously missing.
August 8th, 16:30: Assumed network gremlins were at play, causing slowdowns. Spoiler: No gremlins, just red herrings.
August 8th, 17:15: The network team discovered no gremlins but did spot a suspiciously idle hamster wheel.
August 8th, 18:30: With no signs of gremlins or hamsters, we called in the backend Ghostbusters.
August 9th, 01:00: Desperation set in. The team realized the emojis were playing an elaborate game of hide and seek.
August 9th, 03:00: Frontend team discovered the emojis were trapped in a broken-down CDN limo.
August 9th, 08:00: The mastermind was found—a failed CDN connection left the emojis stranded.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The real culprit? An external emoji CDN that decided to throw a wrench in our works by failing intermittently. The emojis, critical for our users' emotional well-being, were left stranded, leading to incomplete HTML emails and frustrated recipients. We resolved this by switching to a backup CDN and giving our emojis a better travel plan for the future.
Visual Enhancement:
Imagine a comic strip where emojis are trying to catch a plane but miss it due to a sudden "Technical Delay" sign popping up. That’s exactly what happened—only in our servers!


Corrective and Preventative Measures:
🎯 Emoji Detectives: Enhance our monitoring systems with a "Find the Emojis" feature to catch any runaway emojis early.
🌍 Multi-CDN Strategy: Set up an additional CDN as "Emoji Travel Insurance" to ensure our pixelated friends never miss their connection again.
🏠 Local Emoji Vault: Store critical emojis locally as an "Emoji Bunker" to avoid future emoji droughts.
💪 Emoji Gym: Run regular stress tests to keep our emojis in top shape, ready to handle any emotional traffic.
📞 Emoji Support Hotline: Establish a rapid response plan for any future emoji emergencies.
Final Note:
With our new measures in place, we’re confident that our emojis will never wander off again. Because, at the end of the day, a message without an emoji is like a pizza without cheese—possible, but not recommended! 🍕😊
